## Overview

This is an application that can be used by companies that intend to launch their website or a certain product after a particular time. This application is a essentially built to leverage my skills on JavaScript and how I can create functions aside from leveraging my skills on creating perfect User friendly interfaces.

### The challenge

Users are able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second 
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, the card flips from the middle
